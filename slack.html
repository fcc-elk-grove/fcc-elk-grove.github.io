  <h1>Slack Instructions</h1>

  <p>Thanks for joining the freeCodeCamp Elk Grove Slack group! Here are some things you can do to get started.</p>

  <h2>Get Started</h2>

  <p>First, post an introduction in the #introductions channel. Here are some things you can include:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>What’s your first name? (You only need to post this if your display name is different.)</li>
    <li>What do you currently do?</li>
    <li>How long have you been coding?</li>
    <li>What area(s) of programming are you focusing on (mobile, Android, React, front-end, back-end, etc.)?</li>
  </ol

  <p>Next, take a look at our main channel, #discussion. Feel free to post any coding questions or comments you have in there.</p>

  <h2>Optional</h2>
  <p>Share any projects you’re working on in #projects.</p>
  <p>Post useful learning resources in #learning.</p>
  <p>Share interesting job postings in #jobs.</p>
